A simple (REALLY simple) "Coin Chase" game for the C64 programmed in assembly.

To get the project running:

1. Download CBM Studio (http://www.ajordison.co.uk/)
2. Download Vice (http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/)
3. Follow the set up instructions to link CBM to Vice.
4. Open the project in CBM and compile the game (Ctrl+F5).

To build the game to a .prg file, Build->Program->To File (F6)

This was just a test to see if I could create something using 6502 assembly.
